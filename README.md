# Kubernetes Service Meshes with Istio



## What will you learn

This course is packed with step-by-step instructions and realistic examples that are directly applicable in practice. The different sections of this course will focus on the important topics of deploying and running cloud-native applications such as traffic management and routing, rollout scenarios, resiliency, observability and security and how these are addressed by the Istio service mesh.

1. Explore the Istio architecture and its components
2. Install the Istio service mesh in Kubernetes using Helm and manually
3. Control ingress and egress traffic in the service mesh
4. Apply path, header and weight-based routing strategies
5. Perform Blue/Green and Canary deployments with Istio
6. Implement service resiliency using timeouts, circuit breakers, bulkheads and retries
7. Perform chaos testing by injecting faults and errors
8. Secure the service mesh with mutual TLS and authentication and authorization policies
9. Explore and leverage the diagnosability features of Istio
